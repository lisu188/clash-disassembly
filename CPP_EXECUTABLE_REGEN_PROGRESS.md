# C++ Executable Regeneration Progress

This file tracks the parallel executable-regeneration path that grows out of the recovered C baseline instead of replacing it.

## Current baseline

- `clash95_recovered` remains the canonical recovered C static-library milestone.
- `clash95_bootstrap` is the current executable foothold. It reconstructs a narrow authentic startup slice through `bootstrap_main.c` and intentionally avoids the full unresolved runtime/link surface.
- The direct one-shot link of `clash95.c + platform_sdl_runtime.c + compat/decomp_runtime_stubs.c` still fails on missing `main`, `_wcpp_*` runtime families, unresolved globals, late CRT helpers, Win32-era platform calls, and control-flow scars such as `JUMPOUT`.

## Regeneration track goals

1. Keep the recovered C baseline green.
2. Make the executable-link surface explicit and categorized.
3. Add a parallel `clash95_cpp_core` library for high-confidence C++ seams.
4. Add a parallel `clash95_cpp_regen` executable that starts from the existing bootstrap foothold and gradually absorbs more authentic startup/runtime responsibility.
5. Keep the sidecar evidence artifacts synchronized with the live code.

## Batch 125 - C++ executable regeneration bootstrap wave

- Current frontier:
  - establish the parallel C++ executable track on top of the already-green recovered C and bootstrap targets
- Active work:
  - baseline `clash95_recovered` on a clean branch and capture the raw unresolved-link surface into canonical artifacts
  - add an executable-regeneration skill instead of broadening the existing unit-type recovery skill
  - introduce initial C++ class wrappers around the highest-confidence seams (`DLXSpriteSet`, `CAviDecompressor`, `CSyncObject`)
  - wire new parallel CMake targets without destabilizing the existing C build
- Expected outputs this wave:
  - `EXECUTABLE_LINK_BLOCKERS.md`
  - `LINK_SURFACE_AUDIT.csv`
  - `EXECUTABLE_REGEN_PLAN.md`
  - `CPP_CLASS_CROSSWALK.csv`
  - `CPP_SUBSYSTEM_NOTES.md`
  - `SDL_BACKEND_GAP_AUDIT.md`
  - `RUNTIME_WRAPPER_STATUS.md`
  - `STRUCT_RECOVERY_NOTES.md`
- Status at batch start:
  - `cmake -S . -B build` succeeds
  - `cmake --build build --target clash95_recovered -j` succeeds
  - direct `gcc` link probe still fails and is being used as the raw blocker inventory rather than as the executable strategy
- Outcomes:
  - added the executable-regeneration canonical docs and the dedicated `.agents/skills/regenerate-cpp-executable/SKILL.md`
  - added `clash95_cpp_core` and `clash95_cpp_regen` alongside the existing `clash95_recovered` and `clash95_bootstrap` targets
  - landed conservative C++ wrappers for `DLXSpriteSet`, `CAviDecompressor`, and `CSyncObject`
  - kept the recovered C baseline and the existing bootstrap executable green
- Validation:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build --target clash95_recovered -j`
  - `cmake --build build --target clash95_bootstrap -j`
  - `cmake --build build --target clash95_cpp_core -j`
  - `cmake --build build --target clash95_cpp_regen -j`
  - `timeout 1s build/bin/clash95_bootstrap`
  - `timeout 1s build/bin/clash95_cpp_regen`
  - `timeout 2s build/bin/clash95_cpp_regen --authentic-startup-prelude`
  - `python3 -m json.tool RECOVERED_STRUCTURES.json >/tmp/recovered_structures_cpp_regen.json`
  - `python3 -m json.tool UNIT_TYPES_AND_STATS.json >/tmp/unit_types_cpp_regen.json`
  - `git diff --check`
- Resulting milestone:
  - `clash95_cpp_regen` now links and stays alive for the default one-second smoke run, matching the current bootstrap wedge
  - the deeper `--authentic-startup-prelude` path still faults with exit status `139`, so the next frontier remains the existing startup/runtime crash band rather than C++ target creation itself
